<article className="prose mx-auto py-20">

My name is Scott Smerchek. I'm based in Kansas City and work for the remote-first company [UDisc](https://udisc.com),
where I help build our web services (now with [Remix](https://remix.run)) to grow the amazing game of disc golf.

Outside of software, I enjoy disc golf, ultimate frisbee, hiking,
constant learning, and reading epic fantasyâ€”especially works by [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/).
