<article className="prose mx-auto py-20">

My name is Scott Smerchek. I'm based on of Kansas City for and work for the remote-first company, [UDisc](https://udisc.com),
building out our web services (now with [Remix](https://remix.run)) to grow the amazing sport of disc golf.

Outside of software, I enjoy disc golf, ultimate frisbee, hiking,
constantly learning, and reading epic fantasy, especially [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/).
