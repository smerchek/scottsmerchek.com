title: About me
---

My name is Scott Smerchek. I work in Kansas City for [SMRxT, Inc](www.smrxt.com) (pronounced _smart_)
crafting back-end services and APIs to process and interpret messages from
innovative pill bottles with a weight sensor in them. Yes, I get to actually work
with real IoT devices!

I've spoken at several local conferences and have helped with KC user groups over
the years.

I primarily work with node.js and Postgres. I'm very excited about learning
more about functional programming, especially Haskell. For several years, I
spent a lot of time working with search technologies Lucene and Solr, even writing
custom search and highlighting plugins to search millions of medical documents.

Outside of software, I enjoy cycling, crossfit, ultimate frisbee, hiking,
constantly learning, and reading epic fantasy.
